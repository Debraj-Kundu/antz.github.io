        <p style="text-align: left;">The drones are the male ants in the colony. They are usually even smaller than the workers. Their head and mandibles (ant's jaws) are small. One can see their genitals with the naked eye. Their complex eyes are larger than these of workers or females. Their behaviour is inadequate. They hatch from unfertilized eggs, which can be laid in special cases by workers. This happens when the queen is dead in order to keep the colony's genes. In the nest drones do not do any work at all. They even can not feed on their own, but workers feed them. The only aim in a drone's life is to fertilize a princess. After that they simply die.</p>
