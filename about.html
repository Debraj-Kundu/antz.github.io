        <ul>
          <li>There are more than 12,000 species of ants all over the world.
</li>
          <li>An ant can lift 20 times its own body weight. If a second grader was as strong as an ant, she would be able to pick up a car!
</li>
          <li>Some queen ants can live for many years and have millions of babies!
</li>
          <li>Ants don’t have ears. Ants "hear" by feeling vibrations in the ground through their feet.
When ants fight, it is usually to the death!
</li>
          <li>Queen ants have wings, which they shed when they start a new nest.
</li>
          <li>Ants don’t have lungs. Oxygen enters through tiny holes all over the body and carbon dioxide leaves through the same holes.
</li>
          <li>When the queen of the colony dies, the colony can only survive a few months. Queens are rarely replaced and the workers are not able to reproduce.</li>
        </ul>
